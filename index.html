	</ul>
	<p class="job">Sr. Engineer, BAE Systems (2011 - 2012)</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="accomplishment">
			Developed a weather model that implemented GRIB forecasts to create pre-calculated high resolution weather grids. Designed
			a 4D interpolation technique (~90% calculation reduction) that allowed for a large grid to be processed
			on the order of a second. Model was also capable of processing encountered winds in realtime and expanding the measurements
			into the existing grid to improve local accuracy.
		</li>
		<li class="accomplishment">
			Enhanced transverse Mercator projection transformations by utilizing Redfearn series convergence solution, resulting in improved accuracy and efficiency.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="job">Engineer 3, Northrop Grumman (2007 - 2011)</p>

		</li>
		<li class="accomplishment">
			Designed a high-fidelity model of a two-axis line-scan EO/IR sensor. Implemented the model in such a way that it could run
			real-time off vehicle feeds in simulation or process mission plans on the order of seconds for effectiveness analysis.
			In simulation the model could interface with MetaVR (COTS) to generate high-fidelity simulated imagery including movers
			and subjects of interest. Simulated imagery could stimulate operators to more reliably predict workload impacts. Analytical
			mode was used to display effectiveness predictions to assist the operator during mission. Evolved into subject-matter
			expert on sensor concepts of operation.
		</li>

			Rapidly prototyped systems and interfaces years ahead of official development cycles, facilitating Operator-In-The-Loop
			(OITL) events, incorporating direct customer feedback into development.
		</li>
		<li class="accomplishment">
			Orchestrated OITL events which allowed customers to operate prototype systems well before delivery to perform mission goals
			within simulated environments reflective of real-world situations. Vehicles and payloads were simulated with high-fidelity
			models, while threats and tasking were developed from real-world intelligence. Feedback drove system development and concepts
			of operation.
		</li>
		<li class="accomplishment">Managed simulation server farm and oversaw hardware requirements and upgrades.</li>
